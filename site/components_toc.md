The web components may not meet all of your needs, so don't feel like you are constrained to use just these options or force your content to these components. The only official requirements are that your Illinois site must meet [accessibility guidelines](https://itaccessibility.illinois.edu/) and [brand guidelines](https://brand.illinois.edu/). These web components help ensure that you meet these requirements.
