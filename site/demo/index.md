# Demo Pages

We built a few demonstration pages to ensure that everything worked OK. All of the links below open in a new window. 

* <a href="/demo/home.html" target="_blank">Sample Home Page</a>: A sample home page using the components. 
* <a href="/demo/home-illinois-mode.html" target="_blank">Sample Home Page, Alternate</a>: A sample home page using the "illinois" mode on the **ilw-page** component. This is used if you don't want to wrap all of your content in an **ilw-content** block. 
* <a href="/demo/body.html" target="_blank">Sample Body Page</a>: A sample body page using the components. 
* <a href="/demo/body-illinois-mode.html" target="_blank">Sample Body Page, Alternate</a>: A sample body page using the components on the **ilw-page** component. This is used if you don't want to wrap all of your content in an **ilw-content** block. 
* <a href="/demo/card-grid.html" target="_blank">Sample Listing Page</a>: A group of cards in the **ilw-grid** component, meant to display a group of research sites. Includes pagination.
* <a href="/demo/card-grid-illinois-mode.html" target="_blank">Sample Listing Page, Alternate</a>: A group of cards in the **ilw-grid** component, meant to display a group of research sites. This is used if you don't want to wrap all of your content in an **ilw-content** block. Includes pagination.

If you have other ideas for sample pages, let us know and we can create them.
