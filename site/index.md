**Note that this is the new version of the toolkit builder.** For the original version that targets version 2 of the toolkit, please go to https://builder.toolkit.illinois.edu. If you have questions about this site, please see the [Helpful Links page](/links/index.html).

The toolkit is a way to see components that have been designed by the WIGG Web Components group and other areas that have submitted components to the builder. This includes both production and development versions.

The web components may not meet all of your needs, so don't feel like you are constrained to use just these options or force your content to these components. The only official requirements are that your Illinois site must meet [accessibility guidelines](https://itaccessibility.illinois.edu/) and [brand guidelines](https://brand.illinois.edu/). These web components help ensure that you meet these requirements. 

This also generates <a href="/preview/index.html">a preview of all the components</a>. This will be used by the aXe monitor to ensure that these components pass automated accessibility tests.
