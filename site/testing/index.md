This is a testing area for our accessibility testers to test custom pages for accessibility.

## Using the 'ilw-font' variant (preferred)

This is used if you can ensure that all of your content can be enclosed in an *ilw-content* tag and you want to manage the left/right margins through components. This will change your font to the Illinois-preferred fonts but leave everything else as normal. This is the preferred option. Using this option, you will control your content using `width="page"` or just manually control the width of your content. 

* <a href="/testing/home-pure.html" target="_blank">Sample Home Page</a>: A sample home page using the components. 
* <a href="/testing/body-pure.html" target="_blank">Sample Body Page</a>: A sample body page using the components. 
* <a href="/testing/card-grid-pure.html" target="_blank">Sample Listing Page</a>: A group of cards in a grid, meant to display a group of research sites. Includes pagination.

## Using the 'ilw-font ilw-margin' variant (second preference)

This is used if you can ensure that all of your content can be enclosed in an *ilw-content* tag and you want the page itself to handle left/right margins. This will change your font to the Illinois-preferred fonts but leave everything else as normal. This is the preferred option. Using this option, you will control your content using `width="auto"` or `width="full"`. 

* <a href="/testing/home.html" target="_blank">Sample Home Page</a>: A sample home page using the components. 
* <a href="/testing/body.html" target="_blank">Sample Body Page</a>: A sample body page using the components. 
* <a href="/testing/card-grid.html" target="_blank">Sample Listing Page</a>: A group of cards in a grid, meant to display a group of research sites. Includes pagination.
